# Summary 
Algorithms are the step-by-step instructions used in computing for achieving desired results, much like recipes in cooking. In both cases the recipe designer has a certain controlled environment in mind for realizing the recipe, and foresees how the desired outcome will be achieved. The algorithms I discuss in this book are special. Unlike most algorithms, they can be run in environments unknown to the designer, and they learn by interacting with the environment how to act effectively in it. After sufficient interaction they will have expertise not provided by the designer, but extracted from the environment. I call these algorithms ecorithms. The model of learning they follow, known as the probably approximately correct model, provides a quantitative frame- work in which designers can evaluate the expertise achieved and the cost of achieving it. 

算法是用于计算为实现预期的结果，就像在烹饪食谱的分步指导。在两种情况下配方设计-呃某些受控的环境，实现食谱，并预见到将如何实现所期望的结果。我在这本书中讨论的算法都是特别的。与大多数算法不同的是他们可以在运行环境未知设计师，和他们学习如何采取有效行动，在它与环境环境交互。经过充分的互动就有不提供的设计器，但从环境中提取出来的专门知识。我打电话给这些算法 ecorithms。学习他们遵循，称为可能大体正确的模型，该模型提供定量的框架工作的设计师可以评估取得的专门知识和实现它的成本。

These ecorithms are not merely a feature of computers. I argue in this book that such learning mechanisms impose and determine the character of life on Earth. The course of evolution is shaped entirely by organisms interacting with and adapting to their environments. This biological inheritance, as well as further learning from the environment after conception and birth, have a determining influence on the course of an individual’s life. The focus here will be the unified study of the mechanisms of evolution, learning, and intelligence using the methods of computer science. 

这些 ecorithms 并不只是计算机的一项功能。我认为在这本书中，这种学习机制施加，确定地球上的生命的字符。进化过程中的是完全由有机体与除代理和适应其环境塑造的。此生物的继承，以及进一步从环境中学习怀孕后，有决定性影响的个人的生命历程。这里的重点将是统一的研究机制的演变、 学习和使用计算机科学的方法的情报。

The book has the following simple structure. Chapters 1, 2, and 4 set the scene for the natural phenomena to which the quantitative computational approach is to be applied. Chapter 3 is an introduction to computer science, particularly the quantitative study of algorithms and their complexity, and describes the background for the methodology used. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 contain the resulting theory for learning, evolution, and intelligence, respectively. The final chapters make some informal and more speculative suggestions with regard to some consequences for humans and machines.

这本书有以下的简单结构。1、 2 和 4 的章节设置现场为定量的计算方法将被应用到的自然现象。3 章是导论计算机科学，特别是算法的定量研究和它们的复杂性，并介绍了使用的方法的背景。5、 6 和 7 的章节分别包含为学习、 进化和情报，由此产生的理论。最后几章对人和机器使谈一些后果的一些非正式和更多的投机的建议。
