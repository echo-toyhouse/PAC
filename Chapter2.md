“You never walk into a situation and believe that you know better than the natives. You have to listen and look around. Otherwise you can make some very serious mistakes.”1 This was a lesson that Kofi Annan, the former Secretary General of the United Nations learned, not on some far-flung diplomatic posting for the UN, but as a young man in St. Paul, Minnesota. He had arrived from Africa to study economics as an undergraduate. Inexperienced as he was with cold weather, when he first saw local students wearing ear muffs he thought they looked ridiculous. But after walking round the cam- pus on a cold day, he went out to buy some for himself. 

"你永远不会走进一种情况，相信你知道比当地人更好。你必须听，看看周围。否则你会令一些非常严重的错误"。1 这是科菲 · 安南，前美国证券交易委员会-管理学联合国一般学，不是在一些偏远的外交-马蒂奇过帐为联合国，但作为一个年轻的人，在明尼苏达州的圣 Paul 一个教训。他来到从非洲学习经济学作为一名大学生。正如他与寒冷的天气，当他第一次看到戴耳罩他以为他们显得滑稽可笑的本地学生没经验的新手。但后走轮凸轮脓在一个寒冷的日子，他出去买一些给自己。

The logic of ecorithms has much in common with Annan’s analysis. That logic emphasizes listening and looking around. It encourages caution in applying specialized expertise gained in one environment to another, and gives respectful deference to observed experience. It says that it is we who must seek to adapt. 

Ecorithms 的逻辑有许多共同之处安南的分析。这种逻辑强调听和四处张望。它鼓励谨慎在 ap-行走在一个环境到另一个，获得的专门的知识和尊重尊重给观察到的经验。它说，它是我们必须设法适应的人。

Such an adaptive imperative is absent from most aphorisms. “Neither a borrower nor a lender be” urges one to act in a specific way rather than to adapt to one’s environment. The pitfalls of following such non adaptive advice are clear. While the advice may be good in some circumstances, perhaps those from which it was derived, in others it may not be. 

这种自适应的当务之急是缺席从大多数的警句。"借款人和贷款人都不是"敦促一以特定的方式行事，而不是去适应一个人的环境。遵循这种非广告副的陷阱是清楚的。虽然建议可能在某些情况下，也许那些它源自，好在他人不可能。

Annan’s strategy has the strength that it accepts that there are many possible worlds and warns against assuming that they are all the same. On the other hand, it is not too specific in prescribing a course of action. I shall argue that some of the most important phenomena of biology and cognition arise from general adaptive strategies akin to Annan’s, empty as they may appear to be of any specific expert knowledge. Although such strategies as listening and looking are not fine-tuned to any particular environment, they may nonetheless be effective in any environment that has certain weak regularities hidden among all the complexities. I shall suggest that not only are they effective, but, further, they are integral to any explanation of life and culture as we witness these on Earth.

安南的战略有它接受的有很多的乘载世界的力量，并警告不要假定它们都一样。另一方面，它不是行动的在课程规定得太具体。我应 ar 古道，一些最重要的生物学和认知现象源于与安南的一般自适应策略，空作为他们可能显示为任何特定的专业知识。虽然这种战略作为听和看起来不微调到任何特定的环境，他们可能仍将有某些薄弱的海况 larities 之间所有的复杂性隐藏任何环境中有效。我会建议，不只是他们有效的但进一步，他们是任何解释的生活和文化不可或缺的一部分，当我们目睹这些在地球上。

The new word ecorithm that I use to encapsulate these ideas derives from the word algorithm and the prefix eco-. An algorithm is simply any well- defined procedure. It is derived from the Latinized transliteration Algoritmi of the name of the mathematician Al-Khwārizmī, who worked in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad in the ninth century and authored an influential book on algebra. I invoke the word algorithm intentionally. In the domain in which it is most widely used, namely computer science, the standards of explicitness—of what is considered well defined—are high. In the words of computer scientist Donald Knuth, “Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.”2 I want to discuss evolution, learning, and intelligence in terms of algorithms that are unambiguous and explicit enough that they can be “explained to,” and hence simulated by, a computer. The prefix eco-, from the ancient Greek word oikos meaning household or home (and which evokes the word ecology), signals that we are interested in algorithms that operate in complicated environments, especially environments that are much more complex than the algorithm itself. There is no contradiction in this. While the algorithm has to perform well in a complex environment, about which it has little knowledge initially, it has a chance of doing so if it is allowed to interact extensively with the environment and learn from it. 

新的单词 ecorithm，用来封装这些想法源自词算法和前缀生态-。算法是简单任何定义的过程。这被来自拉丁化 Algoritmi 的音译名称的数学家 Al Khwārizmī，在第九世纪在智慧的房子在巴格达工作并撰写了代数上有影响力的书。我故意调用 word 算法。在域中，它最广泛，即计算机科学、 明确的标准 — — 被认为是很好定义的 — — 很高。计算机科学家 Donald Knuth 的话说，"科学是我们充分理解的解释到计算机。艺术是我们做的一切。2我想要讨论演变、 学习和智力方面都毫不含糊和不够明确，他们可以"解释到，"，并因此由计算机模拟的算法。前缀生态-，从古希腊词 oikos 意味着家庭或家庭 (和，唤起词生态)，信号，我们很感兴趣在复杂环境中，尤其是比算法本身更复杂的环境中操作的算法。还有这没有矛盾。虽然该算法具有履行好在复杂环境中，而它最初，亦少了解它有机会这样做，如果它允许广泛与环境交互和从中吸取教训。

Within the realm of computation I make the following distinction. Algorithms as traditionally studied in mathematics and computer science are designed to solve instances of particular problems, such as solving algebraic equations or searching for a word in a text. All the expertise they need for their success is encoded in their own description by their designer. For example, Euclid in his textbook The Elements describes an elegant algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. (The greatest common divisor of 30 and 42 is 6.) His algorithm is correct and efficient in a specifiable sense even for arbitrarily large numbers. Its exact behavior on all pairs of numbers is entirely predictable, and no doubt foreseen by Euclid.

计算的范围内做以下的区别。作为传统算法在数学和计算机科学为了解决特定的问题，如代数方程组或搜索词在文本中的实例。他们为他们的成功需要的所有专门知识是由他们的设计师在她们自己的描述编码的。例如，欧几里得在他的教科书元素描述了优雅的算法求最大公因数的两个数字。(30 和 42 的最大公因数是 6)。他的算法的正确性和有效性宝山钢铁股份来说甚至对于任意大的数。对所有的数字对其确切的行为是完全可以预见，并按照欧几里得的设想无疑。

Ecorithms are special algorithms. In contrast with those designed to solve specific mathematical problems, these operate in environments that are not fully known to the designer, and may have much arbitrariness. Nevertheless, ecorithms can perform well even in these environments. While their success is foreseeable, the actual course they take will vary according to the environment.
 
Ecorithms 是专门的算法。与那些旨在解决具体的数学问题，这些操作中的环境到设计器中，完全不知道，可能有很大的任意性。然而，ecorithms 可以执行好，即使在这些环境中。而可以预见的是，他们的成功，他们实际的路线将环境而异。

The requirements that such an algorithm must meet to offer a plausible explanation of a natural phenomenon, such as biological evolution, are quite onerous. In particular, the algorithm must achieve its goals after a limited number of interactions and with the expenditure of limited resources. The concept of ecorithms and the general model of learning in which they are embedded, which I call probably approximately correct (or PAC) learning, insist on such quantitative practicality. The phenomena that they seek to ex- plain are some of the most familiar to human experience: learning, resilience, and adaptation. I argue that broader phenomena still, in particular evolution and intelligence, are also best understood in these terms. 

这种算法必须满足提供一个合理的解释的一种自然现象，例如生物进化的要求是相当繁重的。尤其是，该算法必须实现其目标后为数有限的交互和资源有限的开支。Ecorithms 的概念和一般模型的学习，他们嵌入，我称之为可能大约正确 (或 PAC) 学习，坚持这种定量的实用性。他们找来前平原的现象是一些最熟悉的人类经验: 学习、 适应性和适应。我认为，更广泛现象仍然，在特定的演化和情报，也最好理解在这些条款。

Evolution in biology is the idea that life forms have changed over time, and that these changes have resulted in the organisms seen on Earth today. Although closely associated with Charles Darwin, the roots of the idea reach back to antiquity and the recognition of evident family resemblances among the various animal and plant species. In more recent history, Charles Dar- win’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, wrote a treatise, Zoonomia; or, The Laws of Organic Life, arguing for this idea in the 1790s. This view was widely debated and controversial. William Paley, in a highly influential book, Natural Theology (1802), argued that life, as complex as it is, could not have come into being without the help of a Designer. Numerous lines of evidence have become available in the two centuries since, through genetics and the fossil record, that persuade professional biologists that existing life forms on Earth are indeed related and have indeed evolved. This evidence contradicts Paley’s conclusion, but it does not directly address his argument. A convincing direct counterargument to Paley’s would need a specific evolution mechanism to be demonstrated capable of giving rise to the quantity and quality of the complexity now found in biology, within the time and re- sources believed to have been available.
 
生物进化是生命形式已随着时间的推移，这些变化已经造成今天看到地球上的生物的想法。虽然与查尔斯 · 达尔文密切相关，这个概念的来源到达回到上古和明显的家族相似性，各种动物和植物物种间的识别。在更近的历史，查尔斯 Dar 赢祖父，伊拉斯谟达尔文写了一篇论文，动物学 》;或者，法律的有机生命，在 1790 年代争论这一想法。这一观点被广泛和有争议的辩论。William Paley 中极具影响力的书，自然神学 (1802)，辩称生活，一样复杂，因为它是不可能产生之中没有一个设计师的帮助。许许多多的线索已经成为在地球上现有的生命形式确实是相互关联和事实上已经说服专业生物学家，两个世纪以来，通过遗传学和化石记录，可用。这一证据矛盾佩利的结论，但它不能直接解决他的论点。组织直接反驳到佩利的会需要一个具体演变机制来证明能产生的数量和质量现在发现在生物学中，时间和稀土来源据说可用范围内的复杂。

The main contribution of Charles Darwin was, of course, exactly so motivated.3 He posited the outlines of an evolution mechanism with two primary parts, namely variation and natural selection, that he argued was sufficient to explain biological evolution on Earth without a Designer. In its simplest form, the theory of natural selection asserts that each organism has some level of fitness in a given environment and that it is capable of producing a range of variants of itself as its progeny. It then attributes evolution to the phenomenon that among the variants, individuals that have characteristics that constitute greater fitness will have a higher probability of having descendants in later generations than those with less fitness.

查尔斯 · 达尔文的主要贡献是，当然，正是这样 motivated.3 他假定的轮廓演化机制与两个主要部分，即变异和自然选择，他认为是不足以解释生物进化对地球上没有一个设计师。在其最简单的形式中的自然选择理论断言每个有机体有某种程度的健身在一个给定的环境中，它是能够生产各种变体本身作为其后代。它然后属性演变到这一现象，不同变异类型，有构成较大的适应性的特点的个人将概率较高的后代在后世比那些较少的健身。

Among biologists there is broad consensus that Darwin’s theory is essentially correct. Biochemical descriptions of the basis of life provide a concrete language in terms of which the actual evolutionary path taken by life on Earth may one day be spelled out in detail and explained. At present there are many gaps in our knowledge. The relationship between the DNA (the genotype) and the behavior and physiology of the organism (phenotype) to which it belongs is little understood. In spite of this, over the last 150 years Darwin’s theory has become the central tenet of biology by virtue of substantial other evidence. Most recently, DNA sequencing has given incontrovertible experimental confirmation for the proposition that the varied life forms found on Earth are genetically related. Nothing that I will say here is intended or should be interpreted as casting doubt on this proposition. However, it remains the case that Darwin presented only an outline of a mechanism. It is not specific enough to be subject to a quantitative analysis or to a computer simulation. No one has yet shown that any version of variation and se- lection can account quantitatively for what we see on Earth. There is much that needs to be explained. Evolution has found solutions to many difficult problems that are of value to life on Earth. These include, among many others, locomotion, vision, flight, magnetic navigation, and echo location. Hu- mans have managed to find artificial solutions to these physical challenges only after enormous effort. 

是生物学家达尔文的理论是基本上正确的广泛共识。生化描述的生活的基础提供一个具体的语言，即采取的生活在地球上的实际的进化路径可能有一天会详细地阐明和解释。目前有很多差距在我们的知识。DNA (基因型) 的行为和生理的有机体 (表现型) 它属于之间的关系是甚少。尽管这样，在过去 150 年达尔文的理论已经成为生物学凭借坚固的中心原则其他证据。最近，DNA 测序已经无可辩驳实验确认为在地球上发现的各种的生命形式的基因相关的命题。我会在这里说的什么都不有意或应被解释为对这一命题产生怀疑。然而，它仍然是达尔文案例仅概述了一种机制。它不是足够具体而无法进行量化分析，或进行了计算机模拟。没有人还表现，任何版本的变化和评卷可以定量解释我们在地球上看到。有很多需要加以解释。已发现演变的对地球上的生命有价值的许多困难问题的解决办法。这些包括，还有许多其他的运动、 视觉、 飞行、 磁导航和回波定位。胡-芒已设法找到人工解决这些物理的挑战，只有经过巨大的努力。

The achievements of evolution are palpable and objectively impressive. The possibility remains that every version of variation and selection, as we currently understand these terms, would have needed a million times as long to yield existing life forms than is believed to have been available. Saying that evolution is a contest or even a struggle for life does not go far in explaining these facts. No theory is known that would explain how competition by itself leads to such spectacular achievements. Lotteries, singing competitions, and gladiatorial contests have not produced similar improvements or novelty. Evolution is a special kind of contest. How are we to go about understanding how this special contest, of whatever kind it is, has been able to produce the spectacular inventions that it has?

进化的成就是显而易见和客观上令人印象深刻。可能性仍然，每个版本的变化和选择，据我们目前了解这些条款，就需要有一百万倍为长放弃现有的生命形式，比相信已经可用。说进化是一场竞赛，或甚至奋斗终生不会远，在解释这些事实。没有一种理论是已知这就解释了如何通过本身的竞争导致这样辉煌的成就。彩票、 歌咏比赛、 和角斗没有产生类似的改进或新颖性。进化是比赛的一种特殊。我们去了解如何这次特殊的比赛，无论哪一种是，已经能够产生壮观的发明，它有如何?

The term evolution evokes many images—indeed almost all facets of the history of life on Earth. I will restrict attention here to the one primary question of how complex mechanisms can arise at all within the limited time scale and resources in which they apparently have. The numerous other questions that are widely discussed by evolutionary theorists I regard as secondary to this one. The advantages offered by sex to evolution have been much debated, but evolution was far along when sex arrived on the scene. The intellectual challenge of understanding how peacocks could have acquired their elaborate plumage was much troubling to Darwin. But again, peacocks came along late in the game. In short, what I seek to address is a gap between the general formulation of natural selection as currently under- stood and any demonstration that any specific mechanism can account for the biological evidence we see around us. Every scientific theory has a gap that leaves some question unexplained. Evolution is by no means unique in that respect. Having a gap is no fatal flaw. However, the natural selection hypothesis as currently formulated has the gaping gap that it can make no quantitative predictions as far as the number of generations needed for the evolution of a behavior of a certain complexity. I believe that the time is ripe for working toward filling this gap. And I believe computer science is the tool for doing it. 

长期演进唤起许多图像 — — 确实，几乎所有方面的地球上生命的历史。我将限制到一个多么复杂机制的首要问题可能出现在所有有限的时间尺度和他们显然有的资源范围内的关注。广泛讨论了进化理论家的许多其他问题我认为是继发于这一个。提供按性别对进化的优势得到了辩论，但进化在性别赶到现场的时候远沿。了解如何孔雀可以获得其绚丽的羽毛的智力挑战是多令人不安的达尔文。但是，孔雀又晚在游戏中。总之，我寻求到地址是自然选择目前下总的措词的差距-站和任何具体的机制可以占我们看到我们周围的生物证据任何示范。每一个科学理论有缺口，不明原因的一些问题。进化不是唯一在这方面。有一个缺口是不致命的缺陷。然而，按目前的措词，自然选择假说是有大的差距，它可以使几代人所需的某些复杂性行为的演化数目没有定量预测。我相信时机已经成熟的努力，以填补这一空白。计算机科学是做它的工具。

This may be an unconventional claim, but I will argue that Darwin’s theory lies at the very heart of computer science. Darwin’s theory may even be viewed as the paradigmatic ecorithmic idea. One of computation’s most fundamental characteristics is the separation between the physical realization of a mechanism and its manifest behavior. This is equally true of Darwin’s theory. Although the fitness of a biological organism depends both on the bio- chemistry of the organism and on all the physical, chemical, and ecological factors present in its environment, the principle of natural selection makes no mention of biochemistry, physics, or ecology, and it incorporates no specific knowledge about the fitness of a particular species in a particular environment. We are driven to the almost paradoxical conclusion that organisms that perform at such a sophisticated level of expertise in physics, biochemistry, and ecology are the products of generic mechanisms that incorporate no such expertise. This striking contrast summarizes the basic challenge that ecorithms in general, and evolutionary algorithms in particular, need to overcome.
 
这可能是一项非常规的索赔，但我会说，达尔文理论计算机科学的核心在于。达尔文的理论甚至可视为聚合 ecorithmic 想法。计算的最基本的特征之一是其清单的行为与机理的物理实现的分离。这是理论的达尔文同样如此。虽然生物有机体的健身取决于有机体的生物化学和物理、 化学、 和生态因素目前在其环境中，自然选择原理的生物化学、 物理或生态，只字不提，它包含了在特定环境中某一物种的健身没有具体了解。我们被驱使到几乎是自相矛盾的结论，执行一级这种复杂的物理、 生物化学、 生态的专门知识的生物是纳入没有这种专门知识的泛型机制的产物。这鲜明的对比总结基本挑战，ecorithms 在一般情况下，和进化算法尤其需要克服。

Given the central role that Darwin’s theory now plays in biology, the following fact is more than a little disconcerting. From the first availability of digital computers many intelligent, curiosity-driven individuals have sought to simulate selection-based evolutionary algorithms in order to demonstrate their efficacy. These simulation experiments, carried out over more than half a century, have been disappointing, at least in my view, in creating mechanisms remotely reminiscent of those found in the living cell. In fact, these experiments are seldom quoted as corroborating evidence for evolution. 

鉴于达尔文的理论现在在生物学中发挥中心作用，以下事实是更多比有些不安。从第一个数字计算机的可用性很多智能，好奇心驱使个人寻求模拟基于选择的进化算法，以证明其有效性。这些模拟实验，进行了超过半个世纪，一直令人失望，至少在我看来，在远程创建机制让人联想到那些发现在活细胞。事实上，这些实验是很少引用作为进化的佐证。

This failure cannot be ignored. It suggests that the natural selection hypo- thesis has to be refined somehow if it is to offer a more explanatory scientific theory. Further, the refinement will need to have a quantitative component that reflects the realities of the actual bounded numbers of generations, and bounded numbers of individuals per generation, that apparently have been sufficient to support evolution in this universe. That evolution could work in principle in some infinite limit is obvious and needs little discussion. But modern humans are believed to have existed for no more than about 10,000 generations and with modest population sizes for much of that history. Our predecessor species may have had not dissimilar statistics. Theories of evolution that assume unbounded resources for evolution, in generations or population sizes, or those that do not address this issue at all, cannot resolve the central scientific question of whether some instance of natural selection does fit the constraints that have ruled in this universe. 

这次失败不能忽视。它表明，自然选择海波论文加以提炼某种程度上，是否它是提供一个更具解释力的科学理论。进一步，细化将需要有一个定量的组件，反映现实的几代人，实际有界数目和有界每一代人，显然已足以在这个宇宙中支持进化的个体数目。进化可以工作原则上在一些无限的限制明显，需要小小的讨论。但现代人类被认为已经存在的不超过约 10,000 后代并与适度人口规模，历史的大部分时间。我们的前任物种可能有没有什么不同的统计数据。进化的理论，假定无界的资源的演变，在几代人或人口大小，或那些不做根本，解决这一问题不能解决的核心科学问题的一些实例自然选择是否不适合已裁定在这个宇宙中的约束。

I am not the first to point out that there is a tension between the long time apparently needed for evolution and the limited resources that evidence from the physical sciences suggests have been available. No one was more aware of this tension than Darwin himself. In an attempt to find corroborating evidence for the long time scale he believed was needed for evolution, he looked to geology. In the first edition of On the Origin of Species he included an estimate of 300 million years for the time needed for erosion to have created the Weald formation in southern England.4 This estimate immediately came under fire from the scientific community. Darwin omitted it, and any other such estimate, from subsequent editions. William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and other authoritative physicists of his day derided Darwin’s estimate as impossibly too high even for the age of the Earth itself. Their arguments were based on applying the principles of physics as then understood to the question of the rate at which the Earth had been losing heat. This in- direct line of attack on his theory of evolution gave Darwin much reason for concern. He wrote, “Thomson’s views on the recent age of the world have been for some time one of my sorest troubles.”5 Kelvin’s final published estimate was as low as 24 million years.6 Physicists now estimate the age of the Earth, thankfully, to be much higher, about 4.5 billion years (and 13.8 billion years for that of this universe). Nevertheless, we still do not have a quantitative explanation of how life could have reached its current state even within this more extended period that is now allotted by the physicists, whether on the Earth or in the broader universe. 

我不是第一个指出，显然进化所需的长时间之间的关系紧张，有限的资源，从物理科学的证据表明已有。没有一个人比达尔文本人更加意识到这种紧张关系。在试图找到确凿的证据，对于长时间尺度他认为需要进化，他看上去对地质。在第一版的物种起源 》 中他包括估计 3 亿年的侵蚀，在这一估计数立即遭到来自科学界的南部 England.4 创造了原野形成所需的时间。这一估计数立即来自科学界下火。达尔文省略它，和任何其他这类估计，从后续的版本。William 汤姆逊 (后来的开尔文勋爵) 和其他权威的物理学家，他一天的嘲笑达尔文的估计是不可能太高，即使对地球本身的年龄。他们的论点是基于原则作为物理，然后理解到，地球一直在下滑热率的问题。此行中直接攻击他的进化理论给达尔文带来了很多理由感到关切。他写道，"汤姆森的意见世界最近年龄有段时间我最痛的烦恼之一。"5开尔文的最终发布的估算是物理学家 years.6 2400 万现在估计地球的年龄，值得庆幸的是，要高得多，大约 45 亿年 (和 138 亿多年，这个宇宙) 的一样低。尽管如此，我们仍然没有如何生活就可能到达其当前状态即使在这个较长的时期，现在分配的物理学家，无论是在地球上或在更宽广的宇宙内龄我解释。

The theory offered here, of treating Darwinian evolution as a computational learning mechanism and quantitatively analyzing its behavior, is the only approach I know that addresses these questions explicitly. Previous mathematical approaches to evolution, such as those of population genetics, analyze the effects of competition on relative population sizes. For example, the famous Hardy-Weinberg principle from the early twentieth century shows that if reproduction is sexual and members of a population have two copies of each gene, as in humans, then diversity in the gene pool will be conserved in the following sense. If two variants of a gene exist in the population in a certain ratio and they are equally beneficial, then their ratio of occurrence in the population will converge to a stable value, with both variants continuing to occur. Analyses of relative population sizes such as this, however, do not address how more complex forms can come into being from simpler ones—this is the most fundamental question and the one that opponents of evolution usually target. One is not performing a service to science if one pretends to have a solution when one does not.

理论提供在这里，达尔文的进化论当作一种计算学习机制和定量地分析其行为，是我知道的唯一办法，明确解决这些问题。以前的数学方法演化中，如那些群体遗传学分析竞争对相对人口大小的影响。例如，从二十世纪初著名的哈迪-温伯格原理表明，繁殖性和人口的成员有两个副本的每个基因，对于人类来说，如果我们多样性的基因库中将保存在以下意义上。如果两个变种基因的存在在一定比例的人口和他们是同样有益，然后他们发生在人口中的比例会收敛到一个稳定的值，与这两个变种继续发生。这样，然而，相对人口规模的分析不能解决如何更复杂的形式可以进入正在从较简单的 — — 这是最根本的问题，并且是进化的对手通常目标。一个未执行科学服务如果一个假装有一个解决方案，当一个人不。

Advances in biology over the last half century have made concrete what needs to be explained in ways that were not known to the earlier pioneers of population genetics such as the eminent statistician Ronald Fisher. We now know that biological organisms are governed by protein expression networks. To understand evolution we need to have an explanation of how such complex circuits can evolve from simpler ones and maintain themselves in changing environments. The protein expression networks on which our bio- logy depends are known to have more than 20,000 genes, and the outputs they produce depend in a highly complicated way on the innumerably many possible input combinations. These circuits define how the concentration levels of the many proteins in our cells are controlled in terms of each other. We can seek to describe them mathematically. For example, the amount produced of our seventh protein may depend on the concentrations of three others—say, the third, twenty-first, and seventy-third. The dependence is something specific, perhaps f7 = 1.7x3 + 3.4x21 + 0.5x73, or more likely something else. But in any case it is some particular dependency f7(x1,..., x20,000) on all the available proteins and possibly on some additional parameters, such as temperature. Whatever this dependency f7 is, it will change during evolution if some other such dependency becomes more beneficial to the organism because of changing circumstances.

在过去的半个世纪的生物学研究进展取得具体需要什么不被人口遗传学等著名统计学家罗纳德 · 费雪的早期先驱的方面来解释。现在，我们知道生物有机体由蛋白质表达网络。要了解我们需要解释如何这样复杂的电路可以从简单的进化和维护自己在变化环境中的演化。我们生物-迟缓所依赖的蛋白表达网络已知有超过 20000 个基因和它们产生的输出在一个高度复杂的方式取决于无数许多可能的输入组合。这些电路定义如何将许多在我们的细胞中蛋白质的含量水平控制在彼此。我们可以寻求为数学上描述他们。例如，我们的第七届蛋白质产生的金额可能取决于三个别人的浓度 — — 说、 第三、 二十一、 第七十三。依赖是特定的也许 f7 = 1.7x3 + 3.4x21 + 0.5x73，或更有可能其他的东西。但在任何情况下它是一些特定依赖项 f7 (x 1，...，x 20，000) 上所有可用的蛋白质，可能对一些额外的参数，如温度。此依赖项 f7 不管是什么，它将改变在演化过程中如果一些其他依赖关系变得更有益于有机体由于不断变化的情况。

What an evolutionary theory must do is explain how these dependencies are updated during evolution. How long will it take to evolve to a new function f'7 if the environment changes so that the new function f'7 is better than the old f7? Of course, this only accounts for evolution with a fixed set of proteins. A successful theory must also explain the evolution of new proteins. I believe that this will need a similar kind of analysis but for a different kind of circuit. 

进化理论必须做的是解释这些依赖项在演化过程中的更新方式。如果在环境发生变化，新的函数 f 7 优于旧 f7 进化到一个新的函数 f 7 需要多长时间?当然，这只占演化的一套固定的蛋白质。一个成功的理论也必须解释新的蛋白质的演化的过程。我相信，这将需要类似的分析，但对于一种不同的电路。

Over the last several decades it has emerged that there are computational laws that apply to the existence and efficiency of algorithms that are as striking as physical laws. These computational laws offer a powerful new view- point on our world that meets the challenge that the facts of biology lay down in regard to both evolution and learning. The laws that are most relevant to these phenomena are different from those that are the most useful for programmers of digital computers, and they need to be investigated separately. This will be our point of departure. 

在过去几十年它涌现了有适用于存在和是一样引人注目的是物理定律的算法效率的计算法。这些计算的法律提供一个强有力的新视图点，对我们的生物学事实躺在进化和学习方面的挑战的世界。与这些现象最为相关的法律是不同于那些对于数字计算机程序员最有用，他们需要分别进行研究。这将是出发点的我们。

Nothing here is intended as the last word on any of the topics covered. The approach I propose needs extensive development both internally and in interaction with the experimental sciences it relates to. The idea that mathematical equations are useful for expressing the laws of physics, that laboratory experiments can uncover the facts of chemistry, and that statistical analyses in the social sciences yield clues about causation are all widely appreciated. But the notion that natural phenomena can be understood as computational processes or algorithms is much more recent. I have no doubt, however, that this algorithmic viewpoint is poised to take its place among the more familiar arsenal of weapons used for uncovering the secrets of nature. I hope to offer here a glimpse of how this algorithmic perspective will come to occupy a central position in science. First, however, we must turn to the questions of the nature and scope of computational processes in general.

这里没有旨在作为对任何主题的最后一句话。方法我们提出需要广泛发展，目的内部和互动与实验的科学，它涉及到了。所有广为人数学方程可用于表示物理定律的实验室的实验可以揭露事实的化学，和在社会科学统计分析线索关于因果关系的想法。但自然现象可以被理解为计算过程或算法的概念是近得多。我有毫无疑问，然而，这个算法的观点正准备采取它的位置更熟悉的阿森纳的武器用于揭示大自然的奥秘。我希望能在这里让我们看到了这个算法的角度会占据在科学中的中心地位。第一，但我们必须把问题的性质和范围的计算过程一般。
