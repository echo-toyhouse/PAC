## 3.1 The Turing Paradigm 
In retrospect, humans have been remarkably uncurious for too long about information processing. Animals take complex inputs when seeing, smelling, touching, or hearing, and then produce behaviors that depend in complicated ways on these inputs. Human behavior can be even more perplexing and hard to understand. Phenomena like these we can observe every day. It would seem natural to wonder: Just how do living organisms process in- formation and decide what to do? Curiously, until recent decades little intellectual effort has been put into understanding this question. To be fair to our predecessors, however, it is clear that, until recently, anyone attempting to study information processing would have been stymied by a fundamental impediment—no way was known of even formulating the question. 

现在回想起来，人类已为太久明显不在乎于信息处理。动物采用复杂的输入，当看到、 嗅到、 触摸，或听到，然后产生以复杂的方式取决于这些投入的行为。人类行为可以更令人费解和难以理解。这样的现象我们可以观察到每一天。这会似乎很自然不知道: 只是如何做生物过程中形成和决定该怎么办?奇怪的是，直到最近几十年来小知性的努力已了解这一问题。为了公平起见，我们的前辈，但是，很明显，直到最近，任何人试图研究信息处理将一直受阻于一个基本的障碍 — — 绝不人所共知的甚至制订问题。

This only changed in the 1930s, when Alan Turing published a mathematical paper, “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungs problem,” that inaugurated one of the most significant scientific revolutions in history.1 The Entscheidungs problem (or decision problem, in English) refers to a question raised by mathematician David Hilbert in 1928 concerned with deciding the validity of statements in mathematical logic. However, in his paper Turing went far beyond answering this one question. He formulated a notion that has changed how we view the world. Through its technological impact, this notion has changed how we live. His discovery was that computation, or the execution of step-by-step procedures for processing information, could be defined and studied systematically. Since that time we have been on a recognizable track toward understanding what such procedures can and cannot do. That is to say, we have come to understand computation. We have also been exploiting that understanding to produce technology, but technology is not my concern here.

这只改变 20 世纪 30 年代，当 Alan Turing 发表数学论文，《 论可计算的数字，与 Entscheidungs 问题，应用"落成的之一 history.1 Entscheidungs 问题 (或决策问题，在英语中的) 中最重大的科学革命是指数学家 David Hilbert 在 1928 年与决定的声明在数理逻辑的有效性有关的质询。然而，在他的论文图灵远远超出回答这一问题。他制定了一个概念，改变了我们对世界的看法。通过其技术的影响，这种观念已经改变了我们的生活方式。他的发现是，计算或用于处理信息的分步过程的执行，可以定义和系统地研究了。自那时以来，我们一直以辨认方向理解这种程序可以做什么和不能做什么。即是说，我们来了解计算。我们也利用了这种理解来生产技术，但技术不是我在这里所关注。

The technical concept of computability makes an important distinction: It is one thing to specify, even unambiguously, what result you expect from a computation for every input of data. It is quite another to specify a step-by- step computation that gets you there. The difference is not immediately apparent. Nevertheless, Alan Turing proved that there exist problems for which there is no ambiguity as to what result is desired, but for which there is no set of step-by-step instructions that will get you the right result for every in- put. This was a stunning finding. Research over the past several decades has developed a rich science for making even finer distinctions, particularly with regard to efficiency. It turns out that there are also problems that are not computable efficiently enough to be practical, even if in principle they can be computed. That fact poses its own problems: We want computations not only to exist in principle, but also to deliver answers within a reasonable period of time. To obtain the result we should not have to wait for months, or years, or until after our galaxy has ceased to exist.

可计算性的技术概念让一个重要的区别: 一件事，若要指定，甚至毫不含糊地，什么是结果不是你期望从一个计算对于每个输入的数据。它完全是另一个用于指定那里获取你的步计算。的差异并不是显而易见的。然而，Alan Turing 的证明了，存在的问题，现在想要什么结果没有歧义，但是是没有一套就可以正确的结果，每个在付诸表决的分步指导。这是一个惊人的发现。在过去几年的研究已发展丰富科学制作更精细的区分，特别是在效率方面。原来也有问题，不是可计算的有效足够要踏实，即使在原理可以计算。事实提出自己的问题: 我们想要计算不只是存在于原则，同时也是在合理的时间内把答案。要获得的结果，我们不应该在我们的星系后等待数月或数年，或已不再存在。

These laws of computation apply to all algorithms. Because ecorithms are algorithms, though of a special kind, they too must follow the same basic laws as computation in general. This new science of the ultimate limitations on the possibility and the efficiency with which computations for learning and evolution can proceed offers a fundamental new approach to understanding these phenomena of learning and evolution, because, regardless of how they are implemented—in silicon, DNA, neurons, or something else entirely—there are some ultimate logical laws that limit what these mechanisms can do.

计算这些法律适用于所有的算法。因为 ecorithms 算法，虽然的一种特殊，他们也必须遵循相同的基本定律作为计算一般。这种新的可能性和效率，可以继续学习和进化计算的最终限制科学提供基本的新方法，对于理解这些现象的学习与进化，因为，不管他们如何实现 — — 中硅、 DNA、 神经元，或别的东西完全 — — 有一些最终的逻辑法律限制这些机制能做些什么。

Turing’s paper contained several ingredients that are now seen as fundamental to the study of computation. First, he described a model, now called the Turing machine, that captures the phenomenon he was attempting to de- scribe, namely that of mechanistic step-by-step procedures. Second, he proved a strong possibility result for what can be achieved on his model. In particular, he showed how to design a universal Turing machine that is cap- able of executing every possible mechanical procedure. This universality property is what enables computer technology to be so pervasively useful, and would be utterly astonishing were it not so commonplace now by virtue of its effectiveness. Third, Turing also proved a strong impossibility result, that not all well-defined mathematical problems can be solved mechanically.

图灵的文件载有几个成分，现在见到的基础，计算的研究。首先，他描述了一种模式，现在被称为图灵机，捕捉到他正在试图向德抄写员的现象，即是机械论的分步过程。第二，他证明了他的模型上可以取得的成就很大的可能性结果。尤其是，他展示了如何设计通用图灵机是帽-能执行每个可能的机械过程。此普遍性属性是一种使计算机技术，所以普遍有用，和将完全令人惊讶它并非是司空见惯的事情现在凭借其效力。第三，图灵也证明强不可能结果，可以机械地解决不良好定义的所有的数学问题。

Turing’s impossibility result is as striking as universality is on the positive side. It is concerned with the problem of predicting, for an arbitrary computer program and an input for it, whether that program started on that in- put will ever halt its computation after a finite number of steps, as opposed to getting stuck in a loop in perpetuity. This so-called Halting Problem is well defined. Once we specify a language for expressing the programs there is no ambiguity at all about what would and what would not constitute a solution to it. It would be good to be able to tell ahead of time whether a computer program will get stuck in a perpetual loop. Yet, as Turing showed, it cannot be solved in all cases by any Turing machine.2 We will never be able to solve this problem routinely. 

图灵的不可能性结果令人震惊的普遍性是积极的一面。是否该程序开始在那放在过将停止其计算步骤，而不是被困在一个循环中在永久有限数目后的，它是与问题的预测，为任意计算机程序和输入有关吧。这所谓的停机问题是清楚的。一旦我们指定一种语言表达的程序是不存在多义性在所有关于什么会和什么不会构成对它的解决方案。它一定要能够提前告诉计算机程序将陷入永久的循环。然而，正如图灵所表明的它不能解决在所有情况下由任何图灵 machine.2 我们将永远无法经常解决这一问题。

Many of the foremost thinkers of the early part of the twentieth century had wondered, somewhat informally, whether mechanical procedures existed for resolving all mathematically well-posed questions. Some, such as the philosopher Bertrand Russell and the mathematician David Hilbert, were optimistic. Turing’s discovery that one could define precisely what such an assertion meant, and then prove that such a statement was false, had revolutionary implications. The shock of this is still taking its time to permeate the community of the educated.

首先是思想家的二十世纪之初的很多人一直在想，有些通俗地讲，机械的程序为解决所有的数学上适的问题是否存在。一些哲学家伯特兰 · 罗素等数学家 David Hilbert 是乐观。图灵的发现一个可以定义正是什么这种说法的意思，，然后证明这种说法是假的产生了革命性的影响。这冲击还处于它的时间来渗透，受教育者的社会。

 
Figure 3.1 An example of a simple Turing machine. The diagram at the top de- scribes the program that controls the machine. The input is the sequence of 0s and 1s on successive squares of the tape. The machine has three states q0, q1, and qf . It starts in state q0 and with the read/write head on the square pointed to by the thick arrow. If the machine is in state q0 and the symbol under the head is 1 (as it is initially in this example), then the path indicated by the arrow out of the q0 node with label starting with a 1 will be taken, in this case the arrow labeled (1, mR) with endpoint q0. Executing this (1, mR) will result in the contents of the square being unchanged and the head moving one square to the right. The end- point of the arrow indicates that the next state will be q0 again. An arrow labeled (1, mL) would mean the same except that the head moves to the left. An arrow labeled (1, c0) would mean that the square is changed from 1 to 0 and the head does not move. The labels (0, mR), (0, mL), and (0, c1) have analogous meanings and apply when instead the symbol under the head is 0. The computation halts if and when a final state qf is reached. The reader may verify by working through this example that, eventually, when the read/write head reaches the 0 at the * sign, the machine will change the 0 there to a 1 and change the state to q1, then move the head back finally to the starting position, and then halt in state qf. (Note that we can obtain an example of a machine that never halts on this input by changing the (0, mR) arrow from q1 to go to q0 rather than to qf .)

图 3.1 简单图灵机的例子。在顶部的德经学家图控制机器的程序。输入是磁带的 0 和 1 的连续正方形上的顺序。这台机器有三种状态 q0 和 q1，qf。它开始在状态 q0 和读/写头粗箭头所指向的广场上。如果这台机器是在状态 q0 和头下面的符号是 1 (因为它最初是在这个例子中)，然后由 q0 节点了箭与标签从 1 开始的路径将采取，在这种情况下的箭头标记为 (1，mR) 与终结点 q0。执行此 (1，先生) 将导致在广场固定不变的内容和头移动一个广场向右。箭头的终点指示下一个状态将 q0。箭头标记为 (1，毫升) 将意思相同，只是头向左移动。箭头标记为 (1，c0) 将意味着广场从 1 更改为 0 和头部不动。标签 (0，mR)，(0，毫升)，和 (0，c1) 有类似的含义和适用时相反的符号下头是 0。当 qf 达到最终的状态时，将暂停计算。读者可以通过工作通过这个例子来验证，最终，当读写头到达在 0 * 标志，机器会将那里的 0 更改为 1 和状态更改为 q1，然后移头回到最后的起始位置，然后在停止状态 qf。(请注意，我们可以获得从来没有停止对此输入通过改变 (0，先生) 机的一个例子从 q1 去 q0，而不是 qf 箭头。)

Important as the three particulars of Turing’s paper are—namely Turing machines, universality, and non-computability—they become even more significant when viewed as an instance of a general class of what I call a Turing triad: an unambiguous model of computation that captures some real-world phenomenon (mechanical calculation in Turing’s specific case), and both possibility and impossibility results about that model. Learning, evolution, and intelligence are all manifestations of computational processes. As realized in nature, they may be subtle and operate near the limits of computational feasibility. We may need a correspondingly sophisticated understanding of computation before we can unravel their secrets. My strategy for shed- ding light on them will be to seek Turing triads for these phenomena also. 

图灵的论文的三个细节很重要 — — 即灵机、 普遍性和非计算性 — — 他们变得更为重要时视为实例一般称之为图灵黑社会类: 一种毫不含糊的捕获一些现实世界现象 (在具体案例中图灵的力学计算)，可能性和不可能性结果关于该模型的计算模型。学习、 进化和情报是计算过程的各种表现。在自然意识到了，他们可能是微妙的和操作接近极限的计算的可行性。之前我们可以揭开他们的秘密，我们可能需要计算相应的先进理解。我对他们的棚顶光的策略将寻求这些现象的图灵黑社会也。

## 3.2 Robust Computational Models 

The reader may have noticed that in the previous section there was an unexplained leap. The assertion that the Halting Problem was not computable by any Turing machine was identified with the claim that it was not computable by any conceivable mechanical procedure. To justify this leap, we will need a notion known as the robustness of models under variation, one of computer science’s deepest and most fortunate mysteries. 

读者可能已经注意到，在上一节是不明原因的飞跃。它不是可计算的索赔由任何可以想象的机械过程发现停机问题不是由任何图灵机可计算的说法。为了证明这一飞跃，我们将需要一个称为下变化，计算机科学最深切和最幸运的谜团之一模型的鲁棒性的概念。

We have seen that an essential ingredient of the Turing methodology is that of defining a model of computation that captures a real-world phenomenon, in this case that of mechanical processes, including those that no one had (or has yet) envisaged. That last part is crucial: With his machine, Turing aimed to capture all processes a human could exploit while performing a mental task that can be regarded as mechanical as opposed to requiring creativity or inspiration. The audaciousness of the attempt has attracted many who would prove Turing’s machine insufficient to the power Turing claimed for it. However, when different individuals have tried to define their own notions of mechanical processes in hopes of creating models of greater power, all the models they have devised—no matter how different they may seem—could be proved to have no greater capabilities than those of Turing machines. For example, having two tapes, or five tapes, or a two-dimension- al tape adds no new power. Similarly, allowing the program to make random decisions, or transitions that have the parallelism suggested by quantum mechanics, also adds no new capabilities. Extensive efforts at finding models that have greater power than Turing machines, but still correspond to what one would instinctively regard as mechanical processes, have all failed. Therefore there is now overwhelming historical evidence that Turing’s notion of computability is highly robust to variation in definition. This has placed Turing computability among the most securely established theories known to science.

我们已经看到图灵方法论的一个基本要素是，定义捕获真实世界现象的计算模型，在这种情况下，机械加工工序，包括那些没有人了 (或尚未) 设想。最后一部分是关键: 与他的机器，图灵旨在捕获所有的进程，人类可以开发的同时，进行可以视为一样机械而不是要求创造力或灵感的脑力劳动。尝试的无畏吸引了很多人到图灵宣称因为它的力量不足的图灵机。然而，当不同的个体有试图定义自己的期望创建模型的更大的权力，他们给出的所有型号的机械加工过程的概念 — — 无论它们看起来有多么的不同 — — 可以证明有没有更强大的功能，比那些图灵机。例如，有两个磁带或五个磁带，或两个维度铝磁带添加任何新的权力。同样，允许程序使随机决定或已提出量子力学中的并行性的过渡还没有新的功能。广泛努力在寻找模型有更大的权力，比图灵机，但仍然对应于一个本能地认为作为机械过程，都被失败。因此有现在大量历史证据，图灵可计算性概念是高度变异在定义中的鲁棒性。这使图灵可计算性之间科学上已知的最安全地建立理论。

This robustness under variation of the model offers the fundamental key and launching pad for our study here. For learning and evolution, robust models are as indispensable as they are for general computation. Without this robustness the value of any model or theory is questionable. We are not interested in properties of arbitrary formalisms. We want some assurance that we have captured the characteristics of some real-world phenomenon. Robustness of models is the only known source of such assurance. 

这下变化模型的鲁棒性提供基本键和我们研究这里的跳板。为学习和进化，鲁棒模型是一样不可或缺，因为它们是通用计算的。没有此鲁棒性的任何模型或理论值是值得怀疑。我们不感兴趣的任意形式的属性。我们想要一些保证，我们抓获了一些现实世界现象的特征。模型的鲁棒性是这种保证的唯一已知的来源。

The discovery of the notion of computability constituted a new approach to discovering truths about the world. The logician Kurt Gödel generously acknowledged that computability theory “has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute definition of an interesting epistemological notion, i.e., one not depending on the formalism chosen.”3 What can be computed does not change as one varies the details of the model. In later chapters, I shall try to persuade the reader that, for the same reason, analogous absolute definitions should be sought also for other notions, and in particular learning and evolution.

发现的可计算性的概念构成发现真相关于世界的新方法。逻辑学家库尔特 · 哥德尔慷慨承认那可计算性理论"已首次成功地给予绝对的定义的一个有趣的认识论概念，即，一个不取决于选择的形式主义."3 什么是可以计算不会更改其中一个不同的模型的详细信息。在后面的章节，我会尽量说服读者，为同样的原因，类似的绝对定义应寻求也为其他的概念，特别学习和进化。

There is, of course, no reason to believe that for every notion for which there is a word in a dictionary there exists an absolute definition, or a robust computational model that captures its essence. Indeed, computability, learnability, and evolvability may be among the few. For most other notions no such robust computational models are known, and although robust models may be discovered one day for some, for the rest no such models may exist at all. The question of whether notions such as free will or consciousness can be made theoryful by the algorithmic method pursued here hangs, I believe, on whether robust computational models can be found for them.

当然，这也是没有理由相信，对于每个概念，还有一个词在字典中都存在一个绝对的定义或一个鲁棒的计算模型，抓住其本质。事实上，可计算性、 易学性和进化可能在几个国家。对于大多数其他概念没有这种鲁棒的计算模型已知的和尽管鲁棒模型可能会发现一些的一天，对于其余没有这种模式可能存在根本。是否如自由意志或意识的概念可以由 theoryful 算法的方法的问题追求这里挂起，我相信，能否为他们找到鲁棒计算模型。
## 3.3 The Character of Computational Laws 
Turing’s contributions amounted to more than a series of specific discoveries; they provided a new way of pursuing science. In this, his importance demands comparison with that of Isaac Newton. Newton’s influence on physics is without parallel, not because he described gravity or made any other particular discovery, but because it was through his work that it became accepted that the physical world obeys laws that can be described by mathematical equations, and that solving these equations could yield accurate predictions of what will happen in the future. Newton’s theories not only had the immediate generality that they applied very broadly to mechanical systems. They had a higher level super generality in that they offered a blueprint for developing theories for fields that had yet to be conceived. Physicists have followed this lodestone of expressing physical laws by mathematical equations ever since. Electromagnetic theory, general relativity, and quantum mechanics are not implied by Newton’s mechanics, but they follow the same intellectual pattern: physical laws expressed as mathematical equations. In this sense, equations offered the wizardry that enabled successive generations of physicists to achieve an understanding of the physical world beyond that of which previous generations could have dreamed. Since the seventeenth century physics has been transformed several times as far as the range of phenomena that it could explain. Even as the particular discoveries of Newton have been superseded, physics is still being pursued with a methodology re- cognizably similar to that used by Newton. 

图灵的捐款共计更多比一系列特定的发现;他们提供从事科学研究的新的方法。在这方面，他的重要性要求比较与艾萨克 · 牛顿。牛顿的物理学的影响没有平行，不是因为他描述重力或作出任何其他特别的发现，但因为它是通过他的工作，它成为了接受物理世界服从法律，可以用数学方程描述和，求解这些方程可以产生准确的预测，在未来会发生什么。牛顿的理论不仅有立即的一般性原则下，他们非常广泛适用于机械系统。他们有较高水平的超级共性，他们提供发展理论尚未被构想的字段的蓝图。物理学家已经跟随这天然磁石自从表达物理定律的数学方程。电磁理论即广义相对论和量子力学不暗示由牛顿力学，但他们遵循相同的智力模式: 以数学方程表示的物理定律。在这个意义上，方程提供了启用一代物理学家实现理解物理世界的前几代人梦到在那之外的魔术。自十七世纪以来物理学已经多次到它无法解释的现象的范围。即使如已取代牛顿的特别发现，物理是仍在继续进行与方法论 re-cognizably 相似，使用由牛顿。No one knows why such super generality should exist in physics. It is sufficient for most purposes to recognize that it does. The physicist Eugene Wigner suggested that we simply enjoy its benefits: “The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research and that it will extend, for better or for worse, to our pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches of learning.”4
没有人知道为什么这种超级的一般性应存在于物理。它是足够满足大多数要求承认这一点。物理学家 Eugene Wigner 建议我们只是享受它的好处:"制定物理定律的数学语言的得体性的奇迹是一个美妙的礼物，我们既不理解，也不值得。我们应该感谢它，希望它将保留在未来研究中有效并且将延长，或好或坏，我们的快乐，即使或许也给我们的困惑，到广泛分支的学习。4
Robust computational models, I expect, will turn out to provide super generality in computer science as mathematical equations have in physics. They will enable the extent and limits of computational phenomena, in all their variety, to be uncovered. Just as, in retrospect, the texture of all the discoveries in physics over the last three centuries can be recognized already in the work of Newton, the texture of much of the new science of the coming centuries will be traceable to Turing.
鲁棒的计算模型，我期待，会变成提供超级的共性，在计算机科学，数学方程是物理学中。他们将启用的程度和极限计算中的现象，所有他们的品种，有待发现。一样，现在回想起来，在过去三个世纪的物理学的所有发现的纹理可以在牛顿的工作已经承认，大部分新科学的未来世纪的纹理将可以追溯到图灵。
One can make some further observations regarding the two fields. Physics concentrates on understanding a minimal set of basic processes that are sufficient to explain the dynamics of the physical world, such as how particles move under natural forces. In contrast, computer science entertains much more diverse sets of processes—in fact, any process that can be formulated as step-by-step rules. As long as the trajectory of objects under the laws of physics can be simulated by step-by-step rules, as appears to be the case, computation will embrace all the processes studied in physics. However, computational processes, though more general than those of physics, are not totally arbitrary. They are governed by their own logical laws and limitations. The laws that govern them are our concern in the present chapter. 
关于这两个字段，一个可以一些进一步的意见。物理集中了解足以解释的物理世界，如粒子在自然力量下的移动动态的基本过程最小集。与此相反的是，计算机科学娱乐更多不同批次的进程 — — 事实上，任何可以作为分步规则制定的过程。只要对象根据物理定律的轨迹可以用分步模拟规则，似乎是的实例，计算将拥抱物理学研究的所有进程。然而，计算过程，虽然比那些物理，更一般不是完全任意的。他们受自己的逻辑规律和限制。在这一章的关注是统治他们的法律。Prior to Turing, mathematics was dominated by the continuous mathematics used to describe physics, in which (classically, anyway) changes are thought of as taking place in arbitrarily small, infinitesimal increments. The Turing machine, however, is a discrete model. Before his time, discrete mathematics had been little explored or developed; in fact, a seldom dis- cussed influence of Turing’s work is the rise of discrete mathematics sub- sequent to it. It is striking that for the phenomena that we shall study here, including learning and evolution, discrete models again provide the most immediate robust models and have been most useful in isolating the basic phenomena. Continuous models are ultimately of at least as great interest, but for the initial explorations necessary to identify the most fundamental concepts they are not the most fruitful.
在图灵，数学由连续的数学，用来描述物理，在其中 (经典，无论如何) 变化被认为是发生在任意小，无穷小的增量。图灵机，然而，是一个离散的模型。之前他的时间，离散数学已经被小探索或开发;事实上，很少迪斯-图灵的工作讨论了的影响是离散数学子序列对它的崛起。它惊人的为的现象，我们应在这里，学习包括学习和进化，离散模型再提供最直接的鲁棒模型并已在隔离的基本现象最有用。连续模型是最终的至少作为极大的兴趣，但必要的初步探索为确定最基本的概念也不最富有成效。
Besides the discrete versus continuous dichotomy, there is a more fundamental difference between physics and computer science. In physics we think of the equation as the immutable fundamental law, expressing such facts as that the gravitational force between two objects is proportional to the square of the inverse distance, and to no other function of the distance. In computation we have much broader latitude in constructing programs than this. We allow arbitrary programs composed of steps from some repertoire of basic steps. The immutable laws of computation are not constraints on how programs can be composed. Rather, like the non computability of the Halting Problem, they state what can or cannot be achieved by any program of a specified kind.
除了离散与连续的二分法，还有物理和计算机科学的更根本区别。物理学中我们认为的方程作为永恒不变的基本法律，表达这样的事实，两个物体之间的引力正比于逆的距离的平方的和没有其他函数的距离。我们在计算在构造程序比这多更广泛的纬度。我们允许任意程序的步骤从一些曲目基本步骤组成。计算的永恒定律不是关于如何可以组成程序的约束。相反，像停机问题非可计算性，他们国家什么可以或不能通过任何程序指定的类型。
