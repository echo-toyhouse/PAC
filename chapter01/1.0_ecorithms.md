#1. Ecorithms
In 1947 John von Neumann, the famously gifted mathematician, was key- note speaker at the first annual meeting of the Association for Computing Machinery. In his address he said that future computers would get along with just a dozen instruction types, a number known to be adequate for ex- pressing all of mathematics. He went on to say that one need not be surprised at this small number, since 1,000 words were known to be adequate for most situations in real life, and mathematics was only a small part of life, and a very simple part at that. The audience reacted with hilarity. This provoked von Neumann to respond: “If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.”1 

1947 年约翰 · 冯 · 诺依曼，著名数学家，是主讲人的计算机械协会第一次年度会议。在讲话中他说: 未来的计算机会相处十几只是指令类型，数已知的对前压所有的数学都是足够的。他接着说，一个不需要 sur-撬在这个小的数字，因为已知 1000 字要足够应对大多数情况下，现实生活中，和数学是只有一小部分的生活和一个非常简单的零件，在那。观众反应与欢乐。这 provoked · 冯 · 诺依曼作出回应:"如果人们不相信，数学是简单，它是只是因为他们不知道如何复杂的生活是"。1

Though counterintuitive, von Neumann’s quip contains an obvious truth. Einstein’s theory of general relativity is simple in the sense that one can write the essential content on one line as a single equation. Understanding its meaning, derivation, and consequences requires more extensive study and effort. However, this formal simplicity is striking and powerful. The power comes from the implied generality, that knowledge of one equation alone will allow one to make accurate predictions about a host of situations not even conceived when the equation was first written down. 

虽然有悖常理，冯 · 诺依曼的妙语包含一个显而易见的事实。爱因斯坦的广义相对论理论是简单意义上，一个能在同一行中作为一个单一的方程写的基本内容。了解其含义、 派生和后果需要更广泛的研究和努力。然而，这种正式的简单性是引人注目和强大。力量来自于隐含的一般性原则下，单独的一个方程的知识会允许自己作出准确的预测很多的情况下甚至没有设想时，方程第一次写下来。

Most aspects of life are not so simple. If you want to succeed in a job inter- view, or in making an investment, or in choosing a life partner, you can be quite sure that there is no equation that will guarantee you success. In these endeavors it will not be possible to limit the pieces of knowledge that might be relevant to any one definable source. And even if you had all the relevant knowledge, there may be no surefire way of combining it to yield the best decision.

生活的大多数方面并不那么简单。如果你想要成功的工作除-在视图中，或在作出投资，或在选择人生伴侣，你可以肯定是不能保证你成功的方程。在这些工作中它将不可能限制可能与任何一个可定义源有关的知识的碎片。而且即使你有所有的相关的知识，可能没有万全之策相结合产生的最好的决定。

“This book is predicated on taking this distinction seriously. Those aspects of knowledge for which there is a good predictive theory, typically a mathematical or scientific one, will be called theoryful. The rest will be called theoryless. I use the term theory here in the same sense as it is used in science, to denote a “good, effective, and useful theory” rather than the negative sense of “only a theory.” Predicting the orbit of a planet based on Newton’s laws is theoryful, since the predictor uses an explicit model that can accurately predict everything about orbits. A card player is equally theoryful in predicting an opponent’s hand, if this is done using a principled calculation of probabilities, as is a chemist who uses the principles of chemistry to predict the outcome of mixing two chemicals.

"这本书被取决于认真对待这种区分。这些方面的知识是一个好的预测理论，通常数学或科学的人，将被称为 theoryful。其余将被称为 theoryless。我使用期限理论在这里在同一意义上，它用在科学中，来表示"好的、 有效的和有用的理论"而不是负面意义的"只是理论"。预测基于牛顿定律的轨道是行星的 theoryful，因为预测使用显式的模型，可以准确地预测轨道的一切。打牌的人是同样 theoryful 在预测对手的手里，如果这样做是使用原则计算的概率，一名化学家使用化学原理来预测混合两种化学物质的结果。

In contrast, the vast majority of human behaviors look theoryless. Nevertheless, these behaviors are often highly effective. These abundant theoryless but effective behaviors still lack a scientific account, and it is these that this book addresses.

与此相反的是，绝大多数的人类行为看 theoryless。然而，这些行为往往是非常有效的。这些丰富的 theoryless 但有效行为仍然缺乏科学的解释，和它是这本书涉及的这些。

“The notions of the theoryful and the theoryless as used here are relative, relative to the knowledge of the decision maker in question. While gravity and mechanics may be theoryful to a physicist, they will not be to a fish or a bird, which still have to cope with the physical world, but do so, we presume, without following a theory. Worms can burrow through the ground without apparently any understanding of the physical laws to which they are subject. Most humans manage their finances adequately in an economic world they don’t fully understand. They can often muddle through even at times when experts stumble. Humans can also competently navigate social situations that are quite complex, without being able to articulate how.

"Theoryful 和 theoryless 用在这里的概念是相对的相对于决策者问题的知识。虽然重力和力学可能 theoryful 一位物理学家，他们不会对一条鱼或者一只鸟，当中仍有应付物理的世界，但这样做，我们相信，没有按照理论。蠕虫可以挖洞通过地面没有显然任何他们受到的物理法则的理解。大多数人类管理他们充分参与经济的世界，他们不完全理解的财务状况。他们往往能蒙混过关，有时甚至当专家跌倒。人类也胜任可以导航是相当复杂，不能表达的社会情况如何。

“In each of these examples the entity manages to cope somehow, without having the tenets of a theory or a scientific law to follow. Almost any biological or human behavior may be viewed as some such coping. Many instances of effective coping have aspects both of the mundane and also of the grand and mysterious. In each case the behavior is highly effective, yet if we try to spell out exactly how the behavior operates, or why it is successful, we are often stumped. How can such behavior be effective in a world that is too complex to offer a clear scientific theory to be followed as a guide? Even more puzzling, how can a capability for such effective coping be acquired in the first place?”

"在每个示例实体管理应付不知怎的没有一个理论或科学的规律，遵循的原则。几乎任何生物或人类的行为可能被视为一些这种应对。很多情况下的有效应对有世俗的和宏伟和神秘的方面。在每个案件的行为是高度有效，但如果我们尝试拼出确切的行为是如何运作的或者为什么它是成功的我们是经常难住了。如何这样的行为能有效在是太复杂，无法提供明确的科学理论作为指导应遵循的世界呢?更令人费解的怎么可以这样有效的应对能力获得放在第一位?"

Science books generally restrict their subject matter to the theoryful. However, I am impressed with how effectively life forms “cope” with the theoryless in this complex world. Surely these many forms of coping have some commonality. Perhaps behind them all is a single basic phenomenon that is itself subject to scientific laws. 

科学书籍一般限制其主题 theoryful。然而，我是如何有效地生命形式"应付"与 theoryless 在这个复杂的世界的印象。当然这些许多形式的应对有一些共性。也许在他们后面都是一个单一的基本现象，本身就是科学的法律。

This book is based on two central tenets. The first is that the coping mechanisms with which life abounds are all the result of learning from the environment. The second is that this learning is done by concrete mechanisms that can be understood by the methods of computer science. 

这本书基于两个核心原则。第一是应对机制生活丰富都是从环境环境学习的结果。第二是这种学习通过具体的机制，可以理解的计算机科学的方法。

On the surface, any connection between coping and computation may seem jarring. Computers have traditionally been most effective when they follow a predictive science, such as the physics of fluid flow. However, computers also have their softer side. Contrary to common perception, computer science has always been more about humans than about machines. The many things that computers can do, such as search the Web, correct our spelling, solve mathematical equations, play chess, or translate from one language to another, all emulate capabilities that humans possess and have some interest in exercising. Depending on the task, the performance of present-day computers will be better or worse than humans. But in regarding computers merely as our slaves for getting things done, we may be missing the point. The overlap between what computers and humans do every day is already vast and diverse. Even without any extrapolation into the future, we have to ask what computers already teach us about ourselves. 

表面上看，任何应对和计算之间的连接可能显得刺耳。当他们按照预测的科学，如流体流动的物理计算机历来最有效。然而，com 电脑也有自己温柔的一面。与普遍看法相反计算机科学一直是关于有关机器比人类更多。很多事情，计算机可以做，如搜索 Web，纠正我们的拼写、 解决数学方程、 下棋，或从一种语言翻译到另一个，所有模拟功能人类拥有和行使的一些兴趣。根据任务，当今的计算机的性能将比人类好或差。但方面 ing 在计算机中只是作为我们做事的奴隶，我们可能想着点。每天做什么计算机和人类之间的重叠部分已经是庞大和多元化。即使没有任何外推到福真的，我们要问计算机已经教给我们什么......

The variety of applications of computation to domains of human interest is a totally unexpected discovery of the last century. There is no trace of any- one a hundred years ago having anticipated it. It is a truly awesome phenomenon. Each of us can identify our own different way of being impacted by the range of applications that computers now offer. A few years ago I was interested in the capabilities of a certain model of the brain. In a short, hermit-like span of a few weeks I ran a simulation of this model on my laptop and wrote up a paper based on the calculations performed by my laptop. I used a word processor on the same laptop to write and edit the article. I then emailed it off to a journal again from that laptop. This may sound unremarkable to the present-day reader, but a few generations ago, who would have thought that one device could perform such a variety of tasks? Indeed, while for most ideas some long and complex history can be traced, the modern notion of computation emerged remarkably suddenly, and in a most complete form, in a single paper published by Alan Turing in 1936.2

各种应用程序域对人类感兴趣的是计算的上个世纪完全意外的发现。一百多年前有预期它还有没有跟踪任何人。它是真正可怕现象。我们每个人都可以确定我们自己不同的方式受到计算机现在提供的应用范围。几年前我很感兴趣，大脑某些模型的功能。在短短的几个星期隐士般的短我跑这个模型模拟在我的笔记本上，写了一份文件，基于我电脑上执行的计算。我用于文字处理器相同的笔记本电脑上编写和编辑艺术单粒子轨迹。我然后通过电子邮件发送它掉到某一日志再次从那台手提电脑。这可能听起来不起眼到现代的读者，但几代之前，都没有想到，一个设备可以执行各种各样的任务吗?事实上，虽然大多数的想法可以追溯一些漫长而复杂的历史，现代概念的计算出现了非常突然，和以最完整的形式，在一张纸在 1936.2 发表的 Alan Turing

Science prior to that time made no mention of abstract machines. Turing’s theory did. He defined the mathematical notion of computation that our all- pervasive information technology now follows. But in offering his work, he made it clear that his goal went beyond understanding only machines: “We may compare a man in the process of computing a real number to a machine which is only capable of a finite number of conditions.” With these words he was declaring that he was aiming to formalize the process of computation where a human mechanically follows some rules. He was seeking to capture the limits of what could be regarded as mechanical intellectual work, where no appeal to other capabilities such as intuition or creativity was being made. 

之前这段时间的科学抽象机器没有提到。图灵的理论做了。他定义我们所有普遍存在的信息技术现在跟随的计算的数学概念。但在提供他的工作，他清楚，他的目标超出了理解只有机器:"我们可能比较过程中计算一个实数的一台机器，是唯一能够条件有限数目的人"。说完这些话他宣布，他的目标正式确定在哪里人机械地遵循一些规则的计算过程。他想要捕捉的什么可以被视为机械的智力劳动，有人被其他功能，如直觉或创造力没有呼吁限制。

Turing succeeded so well that the word computation is now used in exactly the sense in which he defined it. We forget that a “computer” in the 1930s referred to a human being who made a living doing routine calculations. Speculations that philosophers or psychologists entertained in earlier times as to the nature of mechanical mental capabilities equally dim in the memory. Turing had discovered a precise and fundamental law that both living and inert things must obey, but which only humans had been observed to exhibit up to that time. His notion is now being realized in billions of pieces of technology that have transformed our lives. But if we are blinded by this technological success, we may miss the more important point that Turing’s concept may enable us to understand human activity itself. 

图灵成功所以那词计算是现在用在前-明目张胆地在其中他定义它的含义。我们忘了在 20 世纪 30 年代的"计算机"指作做例行规律性生活的人。哲学家或心理学家受理在更加早期的时期的机械的心理功能性质的猜想同样暗淡在内存中。图灵发现了精确和基本的法律，丽芙 ing 和惰性物质必须服从，但其中唯一的人类已经被观察到陈列到那个时候。他的想法，现在在数以十亿计的技术，改变了我们的生活。但如果我们蒙蔽了此技术的成功，我们可能会错过，图灵的概念可能会使我们能够理解人类活动本身更重要的一点。

This may seem paradoxical. Humans clearly existed before Turing, but Turing’s notion of computation was not noticed before his time. So how can his theory be so fundamental to humans if little trace of it had even been suspected before?

这看起来似乎自相矛盾。人类显然存在之前图灵机，但计算图灵机的概念不注意到之前，他的时间。所以他的理论如果怎能如此基本的人类小的微量甚至曾怀疑之前吗?

My answer to this is that even in the pre-Turing era, in fact since the be- ginning of life, the dominating force on Earth within all its life forms was computation. But the computations were of a very special kind. These computations were weak in almost every respect when compared with the capabilities of our laptops. They were exceedingly good, however, at one enterprise: adaptation. These are the computations that I call ecorithms—algorithms that derive their power by learning from whatever environment they inhabit, so as to be able to behave effectively in it. To understand these we need to understand computations in the Turing sense. But we also need to refine his definitions to capture the more particular phenomena of learning, adaptation, and evolution. 

我的答案是，即使在前图灵时代，事实上因为是: 轧花的生活，在地球上一切生命形式内的主导力量是计算。但计算是一种非常特殊。这些楼板很弱在几乎每一个方面与我们的笔记本电脑社会荫庇相比。他们都非常的好，但是，在一个输入企业: 适应。这些都是我叫 ecorithms 的计算 — — al gorithms 派生通过学习无论环境如何从他们居住，以便能够在它有效地表现他们的力量。要了解这些我们需要了解在图灵意义上的计算。但我们还需要改进他的定义，以捕获的学习、 适应和进化的更特殊的现象。

Understanding learning has been one of my personal research goals for several decades. The natural phenomenon of young children learning is extraordinary. A spectacular facet of this learning is that, beyond remembering individual experiences, children will also generalize from those experiences, and very quickly. After seeing a few examples of apples or chairs, they know how to categorize new examples. Different children see different examples, yet their notions become similar. When asked to categorize examples they have not seen before, their rate of agreement will be remarkably high, at least within any one culture. Young children can sort apples from balls even when both are round and red. 

了解学习一直是我个人的研究目标了几十年。幼儿学习的自然现象是怪。这种学习的壮观一面是超越记忆的个人经验，孩子将也概括从这些经验，并很快。在看到苹果或椅子的几个例子，他们知道如何进行分类的新例子。不同的孩子看到不同的例子，但他们的想法变得相似。当要求分类他们以前没见过的例子，他们的协议率会非常高，至少内任何一种文化。年幼的孩子可以排序从球甚至苹果都是圆的红色的时候。

This ability to generalize looks miraculous. Of course, it cannot really be a miracle. It is a highly reproducible natural phenomenon. Ripe apples fall from the tree to the ground predictably enough that one can base a universal law of gravitation on this phenomenon. Children generalizing successfully from their specific experiences manifest a similarly predictable phenomenon, which therefore also begs for a scientific explanation. I seek to explain this in terms of concrete computational processes. 

这种能力来概括看起来很神奇。当然，它不能真的是个奇迹。它是一个高度重复性的自然现象。熟透了的苹果落从树上到地面不出所料，一个人可以依据对这一现象万有引力定律。孩子们从他们具体的经验成功地推广表现同样可预测的现象，因此也乞求一个科学的解释。我试图解释这具体的计算过程。

The phenomenon of generalization has been widely discussed by philosophers for millennia. It has been called the problem of induction. I have found that as a scientist I have some advantages over philosophers: It is suf- ficient to aim to capture the fundamental part of a specific reproducible phenomenon. I need not explain all of the many senses in which the words induction or generalization have been used. Scientific discovery—for example, Johannes Kepler discovering his laws of planetary orbits—may have some commonality with the phenomenon of generalization exhibited by children learning words, but it may be a secondary and harder to reproduce by- product of a more basic and fundamental capability. Turing did not attempt to capture all the connotations that the word computing may have had in his day. He sought only to uncover a phenomenon associated with that word that had fundamental reality independent of any word usage.

千百年来，斐洛 sophers 被广泛讨论的泛化现象。它被称为归纳问题。我发现作为一名科学家，我有一些哲学家的优势: 它是主要旨在捕获特定重现现象的基本部分。我不需要解释所有在其中的很多感官尚未使用词在生产或泛化。科学发现 — — 例如，约翰内斯 · 开普勒发现他的行星轨道定律 — — 可能有一些共性与泛化现象所表现的儿童学习单词，但它可能产生的次要的和难以重现的更基本和基本能力的产品。图灵亦未能捕获 word 计算可能已经在他的一天的所有内涵。他只是试图揭开与有独立于任何词的用法的基本现实这个词相关联的现象。

What kind of explanation of induction do we need? Does it need to be mathematical? There is no better answer to this than what is implicit in the work of Turing himself. I have already referred to his successful mathematic- al formulation of computation. But he is also famous for the notion that is now known as the Turing Test, which he offered as a test for recognizing whether a machine can be considered to think. A simplified definition is as follows. A machine passes the Turing Test if a person, conversing with it via remote electronic interactions, cannot distinguish it from a person. The Turing Test is an important notion, and researchers in artificial intelligence have not succeeded in either building machines that can pass the test or in showing it to be irrelevant. However, it is an informal notion. Unlike Turing’s mathematical definition of computation, it does not tell us how exactly to proceed in order to emulate thinking. As a result, it has not led to progress in artificial intelligence remotely comparable to the success of general computation. 

我们需要什么样的感应解释?它不必是数学?还有没有更好的答案，这比什么是隐式的图灵自己工作。我已经提到他成功的数学基地制定的计算。但他也是著名的现在被称为图灵测试，他主动提出作为识别是否可以被视为一台机器，想测试的概念。一个简化的定义是，如下所示。如果一个人，与它交谈，通过远程电子相互作用，不能区分它从一个人一台机器通过图灵测试。Tur ing 测试是一个重要的概念，并在人工智能领域中的研究者不成功可以通过考试或建筑机器或显示它是不相关。然而，它是一个非正式的概念。与 Tur ing 计算的数学定义，不同的是它并没有告诉我们到底是如何来行事，以模仿思维。结果，它并未在人工智能远程媲美成功的一般计算方面取得进展。

Hence the right goal must be to find a mathematical definition of learning of a nature similar to Turing’s notion of computation, rather than an informal notion like the Turing Test. After all, where would we be if Turing had given for computation only an informal definition? Let us think about that. What would have been an informal notion of the “mechanically computable” that would have sounded plausible in Turing’s time? How about this: “A task is mechanically computable if and only if it can be computed by a person of average intelligence while at the same time doing a mundane but exacting task, such as eating spaghetti.” Few could have disputed the reasonableness of such a definition. But I doubt such a definition in 1936 could have spawned the twenty-first century we see around us. 

因此正确的目标一定要找到学习性质的数学定义类似于计算，图灵机的概念，而不是一个非正式的概念，像图灵测试。毕竟，在那里我们会如果图灵曾给出了计算只是一个非正式的定义呢?让我们想想的。什么会被一个非正式的"机械 com-putable"的概念，会有听起来似乎可信在图灵的时间吗?这个怎么样:"的任务是机械可计算当且仅当它可以计算一个人的平均智力同时做一个平凡但也很严格的任务，如吃意大利面条。很少有人能争执原因手术的这一定义。但我怀疑这种定义在 1936 年可能繁衍了第二十一世纪我们看到在我们周围。

At the heart of my thesis here is a mathematical definition of learning. It is called the PAC or the probably approximately correct model of learning, and its main features are the following:3 The learning process is carried out by a concrete computation that takes a limited number of steps. Organisms can- not spend so long computing that they have no time for anything else or die before they finish. Also, the computation requires only a similarly limited number of interactions with the world during learning. Learning should en- able organisms to categorize new information with at most a small error rate. Also, the definition has to acknowledge that induction is not logically fail-safe: If the world suddenly changes, then one should not expect or re- quire good generalization into the future.

在我的心在这里是论文的学习数学定义。它被称为 PAC 或学习，可能大约正确模型，其主要特点是学习的过程由具体的计算采用有限的数量的步骤如下: 3。生物体不能花这么长时间计算，他们都没有时间做别的事情死之前他们完成。此外，计算在学习过程中需要只有同样有限的数目与世界的互动。学习应该 en-能生物进行分类的新信息与最小错误率。定义而且，不得不承认感应并不是逻辑上万全之策: 如果世界突然发生变化，则不应指望或成未来再需要良好的泛化。

The biology of living organisms can be described in terms of complex circuits or networks that act within and between cells. Our biology is based on proteins and the interactions among them. Our DNA contains more than 20,000 genes that describe various proteins. Additionally, the DNA encodes descriptions of the regulation mechanism, a specification of how much new protein of each kind is to be produced, or expressed. This overall regulation mechanism is absolutely fundamental to our biology, and is called the protein expression network. It is of enormous complexity. Even though many of its details remain to be discovered, we can ask: How have these well-functioning, highly intricate networks with so many interlocking parts come in- to being? I believe that all these circuits are the result of some learning process instigated by the interactions between a biological entity and its environment. 

生物体的生物可以描述复杂的 cir cuits 或行动内及细胞间的网络。我们的生物学基于蛋白质和它们之间的交互。我们的 DNA 包含超过 20000 个描述各种各样的蛋白质的基因。此外，DNA 编码的调控机制的描述，多少新的蛋白质，每种规格是被生产，或者表示。这个整体的规管机制是我们生物的根本原则，被称为 pro 蛋白表达网络。它是极其复杂。尽管很多它的细节问题仍被发现，我们可以问: 怎么有这么多的联锁部分这些调节功能好，高度复杂网络来到在-被?我相信所有这些电路是由一个生物实体与它的环境之间的相互作用煽动一些学习过程的结果。

Life’s interactions can be viewed in terms of either a single organism’s life- time or the longer spans during which genes and species evolve. In either case the information gained by the entity from the interaction is processed in some mechanical way by what I call an ecorithm. The primary purpose of the ecorithm is to change the circuits so that they will behave better in the environment in the future and produce a better outcome for the owner.

生活中的相互作用可以看作一个单一的有机体生命时间或其间基因和物种进化的更长的时间跨度。在任一情况下一些机械的方式称之为 ecorithm 处理由实体的交互作用中获得的信息。Ecorithm 的主要目的是要改变电路，将在未来环境环境中更好地表现为所有者产生更好的结果。

Human biochemistry is an important enough topic. However, our neural circuits, comprising some tens of billions of neurons, may be viewed as being involved in our personal experiences even more intimately. Our psychological behavior is controlled by these circuits. How do these circuits arise in evolution, and how are they updated during life? By the same arguments they too must be the result of information obtained from interactions, by ourselves or our ancestors, and incorporated in our genes or brain by some adaptive mechanism. 

人类生化是足够重要的课题。然而，我们的神经回路，包括一些数以亿计的神经元，可视为更密切参与我们个人的经验。我们心理基地的行为被受这些电路。如何做这些电路出现在进化中，而他们如何在生活过程中更新呢?相同的参数由他们也必须信息相互作用，通过我们自己或我们的祖先，并列入我们的基因或大脑由一些自适应机制的结果。

If biological circuits are fundamentally shaped by learning processes, there seems little chance of understanding them, or their manifestations in our psychology, unless we recognize their origins in learning. We may not yet know in detail the actual ecorithms used in biology on Earth. However, the fact that our behaviors have their origins in such learning algorithms already has implications. 

如果生物电路从根本上由学习过程，那里似乎理解他们，或对我们的心理，他们表现的机会不大，除非我们认识到他们的起源在学习。我们可能还不知道详细实际的 ecorithms 用在地球上的生物。然而，我们的行为已经有这种学习算法中的他们的起源，也有含义。

Earlier I listed as two central tenets that the behaviors that need explanation all arose from learning, and that this learning can be understood as a computational process. These tenets are not offered here as mere unproved assumptions, but as the consequences of the assumption that life has a mechanistic explanation. 

较早前的行为，需要解释理由都源于学习，和这种学习可以被理解为一个计算过程列出作为两个中心原则。这些信条提供不在这里，仅仅是未经证实的假设，而是假定生命有一种机械论的解释的后果。

The argument that these tenets actually follow from the formulation of ecorithms goes as follows: I start with the mechanistic assumption that bio- logical forms came into existence as a result of concrete mechanisms operating in some environments. These mechanisms have been of two kinds, those that operate in individuals interacting with their environment, and those that operate via genetic changes over many generations. I then make two observations. First, ecorithms are defined broadly enough that they encompass any mechanistic process. This follows from the work of Turing and his con- temporaries that established the principle, known as the Church-Turing Hypothesis, that all processes that can be regarded as mechanistic can be captured by a single notion of computation or algorithm. Second, ecorithms are also construed broadly enough to encompass any process of interaction with an environment. From these two observations one can conclude that the coping mechanisms of nature have no sources of influence on them that are not fully accounted for by ecorithms, simply because we have defined ecorithms broadly enough to account for all such influences.

这些信条实际上遵循从 ecorithms 制定的论点如下: 我从开始就机械论的假设这种生物 — — 逻辑的形式进入了由于具体的机制经营 ing 在某些环境中的存在。这些机制已经的两种，在个人与他们的环境进行交互操作的那些和那些在许多世代经营通过遗传变化。我然后让两个 ob 断面。首先，ecorithms 的定义很广泛足够他们包括任何机械的过程。这源于图灵和确立了原则，称为丘奇-图灵 Hy-数，可以视为一样机械的所有进程都可以盖水气由一个单一的概念，计算或算法的他 con-临时人员的工作。第二，ecorithms 是也解释得条件宽泛足以为包括任何与环境相互作用的过程。从这两点就可以总结出自然的应对机制有没有来源对他们的影响，不充分所占 ecorithms，只是因为我们有定义生态思想足够宽广占所有这类影响。

To put this in a different way, the news reported here is that there is a burgeoning science of learning algorithms. Once the existence of such a science is accepted, its centrality to the study of life is more or less self-evident. 

要把这放在以不同的方式，报道这里是 bur geoning 科学的学习算法。一旦接受了这种科学的存在，其至关重要的学习生活是更多或更少不言而喻的。
Of course, the reader should be cautious when confronted with purported logical arguments such as the one I just gave. Indeed, later chapters will ad- dress the general pitfalls of reasoning about theoryless subject matter. It is appropriate, therefore, to attempt to corroborate my proposition. Is there somewhere we can turn for a sanity check? The answer is machine learning, a method for finding patterns in data that are usefully predictive of future events but which do not necessarily provide an explanatory theory.

当然，读者应谨慎面对所谓逻辑参数如那个我只是给了时。的确，后面的章节将 ad-衣服 theoryless 主题推理一般缺陷。因此，适当的是企图证实我的主张。有什么地方我们可以找一个检查吗?答案是机器学习、 数据有效地预测未来事件的但这不一定提供的解释性理论中寻找模式的一种方法。

Machine learning is already a widely used technology with diverse applications. For example, companies such as Amazon and Netflix make recommendations to shoppers based on the predictions of learning algorithms trained on past data. Of course, there is no theory of which books or movies you will like. You may even completely change your tastes at any time. Nevertheless, using machine learning algorithms, it is possible to do a useful job in making such recommendations. Financial institutions likewise use machine learning algorithms, in their case, for example, for detecting whether individual credit card purchase attempts are likely to be fraudulent. These algorithms pick up various kinds of relevant information, such as the geo- graphical pattern of your previous purchases, to make some decisions based on data collected from many past transactions. The development of the learning algorithms used may well be theoryful. But this again does not mean that fraud itself is theoryful. New kinds of fraud are being invented all the time. The algorithms merely find patterns in past credit card purchases that are useful enough to give financial institutions a statistical edge in coping with this area of the theoryless. 

机器学习是已经广泛使用的技术与多样应用规格。例如，亚马逊和 Netflix 等公司对购物者基于预测的学习算法训练以过去的数据进行征询。当然，是没有理论的哪些书或电影，你会喜欢。甚至完全可以在任何时候改变你的口味。然而，使用机器学习算法，它是可能做到在作出有关建议是有用的工作。金融机构同样使用机器学习算法，在他们的情况，例如，为检测轮训-呃个别信用卡购买尝试是可能存在欺诈行为。这些算法接各种相关的信息，如您以前的购买，地理图形模式作出一些决定基于数据收集从过去交易的很多。所使用的学习算法的发展可能是 theoryful。但这又并不意味着欺诈行为本身是 theoryful。新类型的欺诈被发明出来的时间。算法只是找到模式在过去有助于给金融机构统计的边缘在缔约方会议-ing 与这一领域的 theoryless 的信用卡购物。

Much of everyday human decision making appears to be of a similar nature—it is based on a competent ability to predict from past observations without any good articulation of how the prediction is made or any claim of fundamental understanding of the phenomenon in question. The predictions need not be perfect or the best possible. They need merely to be useful enough. The fact that these algorithms are already in widespread use, and produce useful results in areas most would regard as theoryless, is good evidence that we are on the right track.

很多人在日常决策似乎类似性质的 — — 它基于胜任能力预测从过去的观察，没有任何清晰的预测怎样制成或任何索赔的基本理解的现象。预测不需要完美的或最好的可能。他们仅仅需要足够有用。这些算法已被广泛使用，并产生有益的结果，地区大部分会视为 theoryless，其实好的证据表明，我们是在正确的轨道。

However, the idea of an ecorithm goes well beyond the idea of machine learning in its current, general usage. Within the study of ecorithms several additional notions beyond the learning algorithms themselves are included. First, there is the notion that it is important to specify what we expect a learning algorithm to be able to do before we can declare it to be successful. Second, using such a specification, we can then discuss problems that are not learnable—some environments will be so complex that it is impossible for any entity to cope. Third, there is the question of how broad a functional- ity one wants to have beyond generalization in the machine learning sense. To have intelligent behavior, for example, one needs at least a reasoning cap- ability on top of learning. Finally, biological evolution must fit somehow into the study of coping mechanisms, but it is not clear exactly how, since traditional views of evolution do not exactly fit the machine learning paradigm. In studying ecorithms, we want to embrace all of these issues, and more.

然而，ecorithm 的想法远远的机器学习方法在其当前的、 一般的用法的想法。内研究几个额外概念超越自己的学习算法是 ecorithms 的包括的。首先，是很重要的是要指定我们所期望的一种学习算法能够做之前，我们可以将其声明为成功的概念。第二，使用这种规范，然后，我们可以讨论并不是可以学习的问题 — — 一些环境将是如此复杂，它是无法应付的任何实体。第三，是如何广泛功能-ity 一个想要超越在机器学习意识的泛化的问题。例如，有智能的行为，你需要至少推理能力在学习上。最后，生物进化必须以某种方式融入应对机制的研究，但尚不清楚到底如何了，因为演化的传统观点并不完全适合机器学习的范例。在研究 ecorithms，我们想要拥抱所有的这些问题，和更多。

The problem of dealing with the theoryless is ever present in our lives. Every day we are forced to put our trust in the judgment of experts who operate outside the bounds of any strict science. Your doctor and car mechanic are paid to make judgments, based on their own experience and that of their teachers. We presume that their expertise is the result of learning from a substantial amount of real-world experience and, for that reason, is effective in coping with this complex world. Their expertise can be evaluated by how well their diagnoses and predictions work out. In some areas we can evaluate performance, at least after the fact.

Theoryless 处理的问题是在我们的生活中一直存在的。每一天，我们不得不把我们信任的专家判断谁 op-仍超出任何严格的科学。您的医生和汽车机械师支付做出判断，基于自己的经验和他们的老师。我们推测他们的专业知识是从大量的现实世界的经验中学习的结果，并为此原因，是有效地应对这个复杂的世界。如何预测及其诊断奏效，可以评价他们的专业知识。在一些地区我们可以评价性能，至少后这一事实。

We are also exposed every day to commentators and pundits whose diagnoses and predictions are infrequently checked for ultimate accuracy. We hear about what will happen in politics, the stock market, or the economy, but these predictions often seem hardly better than random guessing.

我们也受到评论家和学者们经常检查其直径 gnoses 和预测最终精度每日。我们听到将会发生什么政治，股票市场或经济体系，但这些预言经常看起来几乎不比随机猜测。

In late 2008 Queen Elizabeth II asked a group of academics why the world financial crisis had not been predicted. She was not the only one asking this question. Was the crisis inherently unpredictable in some sense, or was the failure due to some gross negligence? After the crisis a substantial amount of public discussion pertained to this question. Is there a rational way of predicting rare events? Why do humans have so many intellectual frailties and behave as irrationally as they do? Why are humans subject so easily to deception and self-deception? Why do humans systematically delude them- selves into thinking that they are good predictors of future events even if they are not?

在 2008 年年底英国女王伊丽莎白二世问一群学者为什么世界金融危机没有预测。她不是唯一问这个问题。是这场危机在某种意义上，固有的不可预知或失败是由于一些重大的过失吗?在危机后大量的公共讨论涉及到这个问题。有理性的方法估测的罕见的事件吗?人类为什么有这么多的智力弱点和作为他们一样不理性的行为?为什么人类如此轻易服从德贯穿和自欺欺人?为什么做人类系统地诱使他们自我觉得他们是很好地预测未来的事件，即使他们不是?

Many reasons have been given for the difficulty of making predictions, and the mistakes that people are prone to make have been widely analyzed.4 The following, for example, is an instructive argument. After any significant historical event numerous explanations of the causes are offered. These explanations can be so beguilingly plausible that we easily mistake them for actual causes that might have been detected before the events in question. We are then communally led into the belief that world events have identifiable causes and are generally predictable. Hence popular disappointment that the world financial crisis had not been better anticipated can be ascribed to widespread over expectation and naïveté with regard to the possibility of making predictions.

很多的理由，做出预测，难度和人都容易犯的错误已经广泛护坡以下示例中，是有教育意义的参数。任何重大的历史事件之后许多的原因的解释有。这些解释可以如此诱人振振有词，我们很容易会误以为他们的实际原因，可能在有关事件发生之前发现。我们是然后集体领进信仰的世界的事件有可识别的原因是一般可预见的。因此世界金融危机没有更好地预料的流行失望可以归因于普遍期望和天真就作出预测的可能性。

This book departs from this approach and takes an opposing, more positive view. While making predictions may be inherently difficult, and we humans have our special failings, human predictive abilities are substantial and reason enough for some celebration. Humans, and biological systems generally, do have an impressive capability to make predictions. The ability of living organisms to survive each day in this dangerous world is surely evidence of an ability to predict the consequences of their actions and those of others, and to be prepared for whatever happens, and be rarely taken totally by surprise. In human terms, the fact that we can go through a typical day, one that may include many events and interactions with others, and be seldom surprised is testament surely of our good predictive talents. Of course, the domains in which we make these reliable predictions often relate only to everyday life—what other people will say or other drivers do. They are mundane, almost by definition. But even mundane predictions become mystifying once one tries to understand the process by which the predictions are being made, or tries to reproduce them in a computer.

这本书最大的背离这种做法又反对，更多的假定我认为。预测可能是内在的困难，而我们人类有特别缺点，人类的预测能力大，足够一些庆祝的理由。人类和生物系统一般，具有一种令人印象深刻的能力以做出预测。生物体的能力，在这个危险的世界中生存的每一天肯定是能够预测自己行为的后果的证据，与其他人，并准备无论发生什么事，和很少完全意外的惊喜。在人类的条款，但事实上，我们可以通过典型的一天，可能包括许多事件和与他人的互动和很少会感到惊讶的那个肯定是证明我们良好的预测人才。当然，我们经常使这些可靠的预测的领域涉及只到日常生活 — — 其他人会说或其他驱动程序做。他们是世俗的几乎是顾名思义。但即使世俗预测变得神秘，一旦一个尝试理解的过程所预测正在作出，或试图重现他们在一台计算机。

From this viewpoint, the general disappointment that the world financial crisis had not been better predicted was not based entirely on naïve illusion. It was based on the well-justified high regard we have for our predictive abilities, and so it would be clearly to our advantage to identify why they failed. It may be that the world was changing in such a random fashion that the past did not even implicitly contain reliable information about the future. Or perhaps the past did indeed contain this information, but that it was some- how so complex that it was not practically feasible to dig it out. A third case is that prediction was indeed feasible, but the wrong algorithm or the wrong data had been used.

从这个角度来看，普遍感到失望，不更好地预测世界金融危机并非完全基于天真的幻想。它基于的理由充足的高度重视，我们对在我们预测的技能促，所以毫无疑问这将是对我们有利，要找出失败的原因。它可能是，世界在变化以随机的方式，过去并不甚至隐式包含关于未来的可靠信息。或也许过去确实包含此信息，但它是一些如何如此复杂，它不是实际可行，要把它挖出来。第三个案件是预测是确实可行的但曾经被错误的算法或错误的数据。

The study of ecorithms is concerned with delineating among these possibilities. Having the ability to make these distinctions among topics of every- day concern, such as predictions about the course of the economy, seems important. One may be able to do more than merely lament human frailties in this regard. Are there inherent reasons why reliable predictions are not possible regarding the course of a country’s economy? Perhaps one can show that there are. It would then follow that there is no reason to listen to pundits other than for entertainment. 

Ecorithms 的研究与界定这些竞技荫庇之间有关。莱温斯基看起来有能力做这些区分等课程的经济预测每一天关注的主题之一。一个人也许能够做更多，而不仅仅是悲叹人性弱点在这方面。有其内在原因为什么可靠的预测不是乘载关于该国经济的课程吗?也许一个可以显示是有的。然后便是要倾听双关-资讯科技署署长以外的娱乐。

Computation allows one to construct concrete situations in which the world does reveal sufficient information for prediction in principle, but not in practice. Consider the area of encryption. If messages in the wireless connection of your home computer are encrypted, the intention is that if your neighbor listens in, he should not be able to get any information about what you are doing. Even if he listens in over a long period and does clever computations on the data he collects using a powerful computer, he should not be able to invade your privacy. This is another way of saying that the environment defined by your enciphered messages should be too complex for your neighbor, or anyone else, to make any sense of. 

计算允许一个构造的世界确实暴露出足够的信息，预测原则，但不是在实践中的具体情况。考虑加密的区域。如果您的家庭计算机无线词库中的邮件加密的意图是如果你的邻居听，他不应该能够获取任何信息关于你在做什么。即使他很长一段听着，不聪明楼板上他收集使用功能强大的计算机的数据，他应该不能侵犯你的隐私。这是另一种说法由您加密的消息定义环境环境应该过于复杂，你的邻居，或者任何人，任何意义。

How can entities cope with what they do not fully understand? The simplest living organisms have had to face this problem from the beginnings of life. With limited mechanisms they had to survive in a complex world and to reproduce. Every evolving species has faced a similar problem, as do individual humans going through their daily lives. I shall argue that solutions to these problems have to be sought within the framework of learning algorithms, since this is the mechanism by which life extracts information from its environment. By the end of the book I hope to have persuaded the reader that when seeking to understand the fundamental character of life, learning algorithms are a good place to start. 

实体如何应付他们不完全明白的?最简单的生物体都不得不面对这一问题从人生的起点。有限的机制与他们曾在一个复杂的世界中生存并繁殖。每个不断变化的物种已面临类似的问题，要通过他们的日常生活的个体的人一样。我会争辩说有学习 al-gorithms，因为这是生活中的信息提取从它的环境的机制的框架内寻求解决这些问题的办法。通过书的结尾我希望能够说服读者，当试图理解生活的基本特征，学习算法是一个很好的地方开始。
